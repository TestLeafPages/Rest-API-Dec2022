Recap
	limtiations of postman
		- data is limited to json and csv
		- parallel execution is not possible
		- single unified framework
		- limited to javascript
		- dependency injection
		- CICD support
		
	REst Assured
		- less coding
		- inbuilt assertions
		
	what are the dependcies requried for REST API testing
		- Rest Assured
		- testng or cucumber
		
	five step process
		- 1. requirements
		  2. endpoint + resources
		  3. construct the request
		  4. send the request
		  5. validation
		
	REst- assured
		- baseUri                     - add the endpoint
		  authentication      		  - basic
		  REquestSpecification  input - RestAssured.given().
		  object of Requestspecification - input.get(http methods)
		  Response class  response - capture the response
		  response.prettyprint()
		

				documentaion - rest api explorer
	POST
	
		Classroom exercise
		
				- change_request - add the request and response logs
					1- create a request with no body
					2- create a request with body as string
					3 - create a request with body as file
					
	    tranverse in the response
				- json 
					- get the response
					- convert the response to json format(to traverse)
					- traversal
					- .jsonPath()
							- get() - single value
								get(result[0].number) - array indexing
							- getList() - multiple values
				- xml
				
		Assertions
				-problem statement - incident servicenow
					- verify the status code
					- verify the incident number is present in the get request           - has item
					- verify the post response incident number has the String "INC"		 - contains
					- verify the get response incident number is equal to "INC0010030"   - equal to

					hamcrest - inbuilt library
					
					
		Rest Assured - Assignments - should have status code verifications
		a) 1) Update any change_request with the below short description
			"using put method for hemcrest" using the put method and ensure the update is successful
			
		2) update any change_request with the short description " using patch method for hamcrest"
		using patch method and ensure that word hamcrest is present in the response and number is equal to 
		""
		
		3) delete any change_request and verify the status line is equal to "HTTP/1.1 202 No content"
		
		
		b) Chaining concept in jira - status code verifications
					Create
					edit
					delete
					get
