09:20 AM - 10:30 AM		: Cucumber 
10.30 AM - 10.45 AM     : Break
10:45 AM - 11:00 AM     : Classroom Exercise
11:00 AM - 12:00 PM     : Cucumber Continuation + Classroom Exercise
12:00 PM - 12:15 PM     : Recap and Open Questions


Recap
	- why REST assured prefereed over postman
		- in built assertion
		- parallel execution
		- multi language support
		- dependency injection
		- single unified framework
		- easy integeration with reports
		- Better CICD Support
		- external data support (almost everything)
	- difference between API and Webservice
		- all webservices are API
		- but not all APIs are webservices
		
			webservices - when two applications communicate with each other via internet 
			API         - when two application interact with each other even with or without the internet
	- request specification
		- construct the request		
			- query params
				
	- content type and accept
		 content type - when you send data to the server
		 accept       - when you say the required format from server
		 
	GET  - nothing is mandatory
	POST - content type is mandatory
	
	traversal
			- entire sys_id - response->jsonpath()-getList()
			- single sys_id - response->jsonpath()-get("city")
			
			{
				"name":"TEst",
				"city":"Chennai"
			},
			{
				"name":"TEst123",
				"city":"Bangalore"
			},
			{
				details: {
						"Age":"30"
						"Hobbies":"Music"
				}
			}
			
	assertions
		- common assertions
			- status code
		- rest assured
			- hasItem
			- equalTO
			- contains
			
	PreEmptive and NonPreEmptive
	
	Non Premeptive
		1. user makes a request to the jira.com
		2. client makes a request without authentication to the server
		3. server will response back with 401 asking for the creds
		4. client will make an another request with creds
		5. server accepts the connection
		
		- better security
		
	PreEmptive
		1. client makes a request to the user with creds
		2. connection established
		
			
	Jira Patch
		- does not have patch
		

Cucumber 
	- waterfall approach
	- Agile
		- scrum
		- kanban
		- extreme programming
	- birth of TDD
		- test, code and refactor
		- modularity
		- reuse
		- testng - TDD
		- collaboration
	- birth of BDD
		- consistennt vocabulary
		- elimniate ambugity
		- eliminate miscommunication
		- human readable - gherkin
		- behaviour
			testng - search()
			bdd    - searchByFirstName()
			
	BDD
		- java   - cucumber
		- C#     - specFlow
		- python - behave
		
		
	Cucumber
			- dependencies maven
					- cucumber-java
					- cucumber-testng - works as runner
			- eclipse or intellij plugins - cucumber or natural
	
	Keywords
			- given - precondition
			- when  - actual happening
			- then  - after an action
			- and   - chaining
			- but   - negative
	Folder structure
			- features
					all the feature files
			- Runner
					- CLI
					- Junit
					- testngNG
			- stepDefinition
					step definitions
			- 
			
			
			classromm session
				- setup the dependencies for cucumber
				- create three packages 
						- features
						- step definitions
						- runner
				- create a simple feature file for get request servicenow
				- add the corresponsing step definitions
				- start the execution from runner file
