Recap
	1. merits of API Testing
			- Easier and Isolated
			- faster
			- easy data generation
			- less failures
			
			
			
	2. http methods
			- Get
			- Post
			- put
			- patch
			- delete
			
	3. status codes
			- 1xx - information
			- 2xx - success
			- 3xx - redirect
			- 4xx - client side
			- 5xx - server side
			
	4. Payload
			- Endpoint - url + port (https://dev75350.service-now.com:9090)
				if the application is hosted in 8080, then it can be ignored
			- Resources
				- /api/now/table
				- /api/auth/oauth
			- header
			- cookies
			- data (body)
			
			- amazon.com:9091/api/apparels/gender
			- amazon.com:9091/api/electronics/mobile (query params - apple, samsung)
			- amazon.com:9091/api/electronics/laptops
			
	5. variables
			- global		- across all collections .
			- environment	- different env - [QA,DEV,PRE-PROD,PROD,UAT]
			- collection	- specific to the collection
			- data			- json,csv
			- local			- applies to only that request
			
	6. limitaitons of postman
			- external data support is limited to json and csv
			- semi automation tool , cannot be used for large scale automation
			- parallel execution
			- single unified framework
			- limited to javascript
			- dependency injection
			
		API Architecture
			- SOAP
			- Rest  - 60 to 70 %
			- grapqhl - 10 to 20 % , social media backgroud
			- gRPC  - streaming realted, netflix, amazon prime
			
	Rest-Assured - Java
			- library or tool or API or dependency
			- httpclient
			- okhttp
			- openhttp
			- unirest
			why Rest-assured
				- less-coding
				- designed especially for automation testers
				- in built -assertions
			- 3 conditions
				- pre-conditions
				- real tests
				- verification
			- cucumber style
				- Given
				- when
				- Then
				
	Five step process
			1. Requirements
			2. Endpoint with resources
			3. Construct the request
			4. Send the request
			5. Validate the response
			
			how to use rest assured
				- maven
					- build management tool
					- works only for java
					  - group id    - company name  (maruti suzuki)
					  - artifact id - project name  (Swift, Swift desire, Alto)
					  - version     - LXI,VXI
					  
					  
		Classroom exercise
					- create a maven project
					- add the RestAssured and testng libraries
					- make sure there are no errors
					
					
					
					contentType - when client sends the data to server on specific format
					accept      - when client demands the server to send the response in specific format
					
					by deafult the response from the server is json format
					
					content type is mandatory for post 
					
					
					classroom exercise
					1)			- get all the records in change_request
								- i should see the reponse in xml
								- i should see only the number,category and sys_id
								- i should see only the records related to hardware
								
					2) try the below
							- post
							- put
							- patch
							- delete
							
					debug
						1) maven force snapshot update
						2) RestAssured will not show as import - check the POM, if the dependecy has the scope tag
								then 
									1 - remove the scope tag (or)
									2 - write your tests under src/test/java
									3 - testng plugin
											- go to market place and download the testng plugin
									4 - install the other version of eclipse
											- you can download the testng packaged version of eclipse 
											
								
								additional assignment -  CRUD opeartions 
									- create a issue in jira using rest assured
